- Topic: Student performance and learning styles.

- Business case: Predicting student performance. 

Objective: The central aim is to leverage data to make informed predictions about student outcomes. This can then guide interventions designed to enhance academic success and foster better educational environments.

This Dataset is synthetically generated to simulate real-world student performance and learning habits. The Data was created using Python and the Numpy and Pandas libraries to model realistic distributions of students behaviors, studdy patterns, and academic performance. 

Data Generationn process

The Data set was generated using the following logic:
1. Demographics: Randomly Assigned ages (19-30 years) and gender distribution (Male, Female, other)
2. Study Habits: Study hours per week (5-50 hours) and preferred learning styles (Visual, Auditory, Reading/Writing, Kinesthetic)
3. Online Learning and Participation: Number of online courses completed (0-20) and discussion participation (Yes/No)
4. Performance Metrics: Assignment completion rates, attendance percentages, and exam scores, all generated within a logic range.
5. Behavioral factors: Time spent on social medi (0-30 hours per week), self reported stress level (Low, Medium, High), and sleep hours per night (4-10 hours).
6. Final grades: Assigned based on exam scores an A-F grading scores.

7. Transformation and Considerations
8. The Dataset follows realistic probability distributions to simulate real-world trends.
9. No personally identifiable information (PII) is included to maintan privacy.
